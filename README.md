## About
NewsExplorer is a website where users can search for news of any topic and save the ones they like to read later.  

This project was made as the final project from TripleTen's online web development bootcamp.
In this project I applied everything that I learned about React and front-end development.

There's also the back-end repository for this project, and you can check it [here](https://github.com/anynoise00/news-explorer-backend).
