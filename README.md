NewsExplorer is a website where users can search for news of any topic and save the ones they like to read later.

## About
This project was made as the final project from TripleTen's online web development bootcamp.
In this project I applied everything that I learned about React and front-end development.

There's also the back-end repository for this project, and you can check it [here](https://github.com/anynoise00/news-explorer-backend).
